# The Touchback Screen

## What it is

Regular touchscreens are great, but they have one massive problem.  You can't use a touchscreen by feel.  That's where the touchback screen comes in.  By using a force-sensing system and a series of vibration motors, the touchback screen lets you feel where on the screen your finger is.

## How it works

(stylized schematic goes here)

The touchback screen uses a regular capacitive touch screen, mounted on a force sensor.  The capacitive screen tracks where the user's finger is, and a series of vibration motors give feedback whenever the user's finger moves between parts of the interfact.  When the user presses firmly on the screen, the force sensor registers that as a press, which is signalled to the user via the same vibration motors.
