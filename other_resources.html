<p><u>But How Do It Know</u> is a very good text book, and one of my inspirations for this site. It’s a general description of how digital logic can be assembled into a computer, and definitely worth a read for anyone with the privilege of dropping a few dollars on a book. While the book is of quality, it does have three main differences from this site’s goal:</p>
<ol start="0" type="1">
<li>It’s a print book, though with ebooks available.<br />
While that medium works for a lot of people, it has its limits.</li>
<li>This book is primarily discussing a computer contrived strictly for the purposes of its explanation, and while that computer is explained in its entirety, the book doesn’t make much reference to real systems.</li>
<li>The book only covers the very core (CPU and RAM) of the computer. That’s probably not enough to do anything useful - computers need I/O, human interface devices, and myriad other components that this book doesn’t cover in any real detail.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="ben-eaters-youtube-series"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU">Ben Eater’s YouTube Series</a></h2>
<p>Ben Eater is a YouTube creator who regularly produces instructional videos, including (linked above) an entire playlist regarding the construction of a simple 8-bit computer. While this playlist in isolation has many of the same criticisms as <u>But How Do It Know</u>, (1) it’s free, and (2) it doesn’t exist in a vacuum - this creator’s other content ranges from a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&amp;list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH">VGA driver made entirely of logic gates and ROM</a>, to more sophisticated projects about basic computer design principles using existing but still very simple computers like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq5YpKHXJDM&amp;list=PLowKtXNTBypFWff2QjXCWuSfJDWcvE0Vm">Arduinos</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&amp;list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH">the historic 6502</a>. Also of note, is the fact that these aren’t just designs in a book or simulations in a computer - Ben Eater actually builds these devices on camera, and even <a href="https://eater.net/shop">assembles kits for you to follow along</a>. If you want a more guided hands-on experience, then check this out.</p>
<h2 id="nand2tetris"><a href="https://www.nand2tetris.org">Nand2Tetris</a></h2>
<p><u>Nand2Tetris</u> is an online-available course regarding digital logic, recommended if someone wants a guided, more accountable exploration. I can’t effectively criticize it, since I haven’t used it directly, but I felt I’d at least mention it, since it is doing essentially the same thing as me (albeit in a radically different format).</p>
<h2 id="digital"><a href="https://github.com/hneemann/Digital">Digital</a></h2>
<p>As you’re learning, it might not always be convenient or economically feasible to use physical components. Therefore, I felt it important to mention at least one simulator. This one uses Java, so it’s inherently cross-platform; and it’s graphical, so you don’t have to learn a hardware description language. Heck, I’ll probably use it, at minimum to generate demonstration images.</p>
