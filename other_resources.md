## [But How Do It Know](http://buthowdoitknow.com/)

<u>But How Do It Know</u> is a very good text book, and one of my inspirations for this site.
It's a general description of how digital logic can be assembled into a computer, and definitely
worth a read for anyone with the privilege of dropping a few dollars on a book.  While the book is
of quality, it does have three main differences from this site's goal:

0. It's a print book.  While that medium works for a lot of people, it has its limits.
1. This book is primarily discussing a computer contrived strictly for the purposes of its explanation,
   and while that computer is explained in its entirety, the book doesn't make much reference to real
   systems.
2. The book only covers the very core (CPU and RAM) of the computer.  That's probably not enough to do
   anything useful - computers need I/O, human interface devices, and myriad other components that this
   book doesn't cover in any real detail.

## [Ben Eater's YouTube Series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU)

Ben Eater is a YouTube creator who regularly produces instructional videos, including (linked above)
an entire playlist regarding the construction of a simple 8-bit computer.  While this playlist in
isolation has many of the same criticisms as <u>But How Do It Know</u>, (1) it's free, and (2) it
doesn't exist in a vacuum - this creator's other content ranges from a [VGA driver made entirely
of logic gates and ROM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH), to more sophisticated projects about basic
computer designs using existing but still very simple computers like
[Arduinos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eq5YpKHXJDM&list=PLowKtXNTBypFWff2QjXCWuSfJDWcvE0Vm) and
[the historic 6502](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LnzuMJLZRdU&list=PLowKtXNTBypFbtuVMUVXNR0z1mu7dp7eH).
Also of note, is the fact that these aren't just designs in a book or simulations in a computer - Ben
Eater actually builds these devices on camera, and even
[assembles kits for you to follow along](https://eater.net/shop).

## [Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org)

<u>Nand2Tetris</u> is an online-available course regarding digital logic, recommended if someone
wants a guided, more accountable exploration.  I can't effectively criticize it, since I haven't
used it directly, but I felt I'd at least mention it, since it is doing essentially the same thing
as me (albeit in a radically different format).

## [Digital](https://github.com/hneemann/Digital)

As you're learning, it might not always be convenient or economically feasible to use physical components.
Therefore, I felt it important to mention at least one simulator.  This one uses Java, so it's inherently
cross-platform; and it's graphical, so you don't have to learn a hardware description language.  Heck, I'll
probably use it, at minimum to generate demonstration images.
